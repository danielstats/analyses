## Background

I have lived in Rexburg, Idaho for almost 4 years. In that time, restaurants have come and gone; the old Wendy's was torn down and they started building another one; so-called "dirty" soda shops have become an epidemic in the Intermountain West (2 locations of "Pick Me Up", A place called Sodavine, 3 ), and 


```{r, warning = FALSE, message = FALSE}
ggplot(rxbrg, aes(y = converted_sec, x = items)) + geom_point(aes(color = Location)) + geom_smooth(method = "lm", se = FALSE)
```
