![first LDS Hymnbook, 1835](./images/first_hymnal.jpeg)

Members of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints sing from a selection of songs, known as hymns, in their worship services. These hymns are collected in a hymnal published by the Church since 1835 with periodic revisions (including a new, internationalized version currently in development as of 2022). While the early hymnbooks contained only a selection of texts which were then sung according to whatever tune the singers chose, modern hymnbooks are broken into 4-part piano scores and arranged by topic, with a thorough index of topics, titles, and authors in the back. 

There is a strong tradition of choral singing in The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, ranging from the semi-professional Tabernacle Choir on Temple Square to the ward choirs that the Church's [General handbook](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/manual/general-handbook/19-music?lang=eng#title_number51) encourages. Indeed, that same handbook states that "Choirs are encouraged to use the hymns of the Church" as found in the hymnbook. Therefore, those Church members who can read music are well-accustomed to singing from these 4 part arrangements, whose individual voices are traditionally called Soprano, Alto, Tenor, and Bass (the common nickname for this arrangement is therefore SATB). In other words, in the SATB-arranged hymnbook the choir sings one of the four notes played by the piano/organ.

### The Bass part is boring?

Some have claimed that the Bass part, the lowest notes in the song, is more "boring" or "same-y" than the other parts. While this is not the place for a discussion of musical theory, it is noteworthy to state that the Soprano part sings the melody, or guiding tune of the song, while the Alto, Tenor, and Bass parts provide harmony or accompaniment. Therefore, it seems reasonable to conclude that Sopranos, most of the time, have the more interesting part; barring those rarer cases when the melody is carried by a different part. 

The particular question of whether or not the Bass part is the most boring is difficult to quantify, however one method could be to examine how often, in each song, the Bass part changes pitch. This analysis will focus on one small aspect of that pitch variability, leaving analysis of the total variance during the hymn to another investigation.

While pondering upon the potential boring-ness of the Bass part, the researcher discovered an apparent trend within the hymnbook. It seemed as though many hymns had Bass parts which began and ended on the same note precisely, while the Soprano, Alto, and Tenor parts did not. This would mean that between the separate verses of the hymns, the Bass part would stay on the same note; they could essentially hold that note over to the next verse of the song. We will henceforth refer to this characteristic as **pitch carry-over.** 

Being a carry-over hymn would, surely, be an indication of "boring"-ness. Therefore, the present research will limit itself strictly to the investigation of this proposition; namely that *those singing the Bass part in the hymnbook of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints have a statistically higher likelihood to experience pitch carry-over.*

To investigate this proposition, we will utilize a Chi-squared Test of Independence and express our Null/Alternative Hypotheses thusly:

$$
  H_0: \text{Incidence of Pitch Carry-over and Part are Independent} \\
  H_a: \text{Incidence of Pitch Carry-over and Part are Associated}
$$

We will analyze our findings with $\alpha = .05$

### Data and Wrangling

The story of this data is somewhat complex and involves a months-long journey spanning several colleges. However, suffice to say that without the incredible work of Brother Joey Stanley in the BYU Department of Linguistics and his [LDS Hymn Selection](http://hymnstats.blogspot.com/) site, this analysis could not have happened. The data itself was sent in a personal email from Brother Stanley, and is therefore read in by the local machine. From there, it gets a little messy. Because of the way the data was originally organized, it had to be manipulated in complex ways to produce a so-called "tidy" dataset. From an original format with all the hymns separated by a blank line and their title, parts in separate columns and every note a separate row, the dataframe was manipulated to have 1 column each for hymn, title, part, first note, last note, the difference between the notes, and whether or not that difference is zero. It is this variable, the logical true/false of same ending/starting note, that will be utilized for the analysis. Below code demonstrates the wrangling and shows an example of what all 22,435 rows of the file looked like:

```{r rangle, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE, cache = TRUE}
#read in data
hims <- rio::import("data/music_quantified.xlsx") |> 
  select(s_note,a_note,t_note,b_note) |> 
  mutate(row = seq_along(s_note)) 

#extract indices of hymn titles
bob2 <- str_which(hims$s_note, "[:alpha:]")
names <- rep(NA, 365)
for (i in 1:365 ) {
  names[i] <- hims[bob2[i],1]
}
hymnss <- bind_cols(tibble(hymn = bob2),tibble(name = names))
#create grouping variable using floor_val function for all rows
himm <- hims |> 
  mutate(hymn = map_dbl(row, floor_val, x = bob2))
#pull out first and last note of every hymn, separate by part and tidy
hymns <- himm |> 
    na.omit() |> 
  group_by(hymn) |> 
  summarise(s_first = as.numeric(na.omit(s_note)[2]),
            s_last = as.numeric(na.omit(s_note)[length(na.omit(s_note))]),
            a_first = na.omit(a_note)[2],
            a_last = na.omit(a_note)[length(na.omit(a_note))],
            t_first = na.omit(t_note)[2],
            t_last = na.omit(t_note)[length(na.omit(t_note))],
            b_first = na.omit(b_note[2]),
            b_last = na.omit(b_note)[length(na.omit(b_note))]) |> 
  pivot_longer(values_to = "Note", 
               names_to = "Part", 
               cols = c(s_first:b_last)) |> 
  separate(col = Part, into = c("part", "position"), sep = "_") |> 
  pivot_wider(names_from = position, values_from =  Note) |> 
  mutate(part = factor(case_when(part == "s" ~ "Soprano",
                          part == "a" ~ "Alto",
                          part == "t" ~ "Tenor",
                          part == "b" ~ "Bass"), 
                       levels = c("Soprano", "Alto", "Tenor", "Bass")),
         diff = first - last, #create numerical of differences between first/last note
         same = diff == 0) |> #create logical of whether first/last note are the same
  left_join(hymnss) #attach hymn names to the dataset

```


### Overview of the Data

With cleaned and wrangled data, we are left with a smaller dataset than previously. This is because not all the songs in The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints' hymnbook are arranged in four parts. We will exclude those songs, leaving us with a sample of 308 separate hymns. Let us examine a plot of the data:

```{r}
subb <- "Data from the hymnal of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints"
ggplot(hymns, aes(x = same, fill = part)) + 
  geom_bar(position = "dodge") +
  labs(title = "Is Pitch Carry-over more common for Basses?",
       y = "Cases of pitch carry-over",
       x = "Does pitch carry between verses?",
       subtitle = subb,
       fill = "Part") +
  theme(panel.background = element_rect(fill = "white"),
        panel.grid.major.x = element_blank(),
        panel.grid.major.y = element_line(color = "grey12"),
        panel.grid.minor.y = element_line(color = "grey13")) +
  scale_fill_nejm()

```

There is an almost symmetrical relationship between Bass and Soprano in this plot, with far more cases of pitch carry-over for Bass than any other part. This is further reinforced by a table of the counts per part:

```{r}

pander(table(hymns$same, hymns$part))
```

Interestingly, the Alto and Tenor parts both have roughly equal numbers of carry-over vs. non-carry-over hymns. The Soprano part appears the most variable, and Basses the least so. Although we see what seem to be clear patterns, we can not determine if they are statistically significant until we analyze the data using a hypothesis test.


## Analysis 

Because this question is categorical in nature, we can address it using a Chi-squared test of independence. This statistical test will determine if there is evidence that the counts of pitch carry-over depend upon the vocal part. Before assessing the results of the test, we will examine a table of expected values to determine whether Chi-squared testing is appropriate for this data. If the test is appropriate, we will see a value of 5 for each expected coung, or a mean of at least five with no count less than 1.

```{r}
hym_sq <- chisq.test(table(hymns$same, hymns$part))
hym_sq$expected |> pander(caption = "Table of Expected Values")
```

As seen in the table of expected values, all counts are at least 5, so it is appropriate to perform a Chi-squared test upon our data. Doing so, we find the following:

```{r}

pander(hym_sq, caption = "Results of Chi-squared Test")

```

With a Test statistic of 153.4 and 3 degrees of freedom, we find a p-value of 4.861e-33. In standard notation, this is $4.861$ with 33 zeros in front of it, a remarkably small number well below $\alpha = .05$. Therefore, we have significant evidence to conclude that the vocal part you sing is associated with the incidence of pitch carry-over in the hymnbook of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. To further investigate which parts specifically affect this association, we will examine a table of Pearson's Residuals. In examining this table, we are looking for which values are the farthest away from 0, as that will indicate they are contributing to the low p-value.

```{r}

pander(hym_sq$residuals, caption = "Table of Pearson's Residuals")

```

As seen in the table of residuals, the Bass and Soprano parts have residual values far from zero, with far more counts of pitch carry-over for the Bass part and far less for the Soprano part than if they were independent. Therefore, we may conclude that those who sing Bass will indeed experience statistically significantly greater incidence of pitch carry-over when singing from the hymnbook of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. 


## Conclusion

Having found a significant result, it is important to consider why that might be. In every hymn, the melody, rhythm, harmony, and dynamics work together to produce the sound. While everyone likes to sing the lead part, the song simply wouldn't sound good if they did. Furthermore, we must remember that the vocal parts and the piano parts are, in this hymnbook, the same. It is unreasonable to expect that a congregation's pianist (they are not professional players but volunteers) will play 4 complex parts at once, rather the bottom two parts most often exist to provide a solid harmony to the far more interesting melody. So while we have found a significant result, it is unlikely that there is much real-world application for this result. However, it would be very interesting to reexamine this dataset with an eye not towards the pitch carry-over but towards total pitch variability in each song, to see which hymns are the **most** boring for those blessed to sing Bass.
