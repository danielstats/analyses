# analyses
Some statistical analyses performed either as part of a class or for personal enjoyment. 

Many of these files (All of them from before Fall 2022) were written origninally as RMarkdown documents which were published as html pages. Because html pages cannot be shown on the web by Github, I've taken the launch of Quarto as an opportunity to translate my .Rmd files into .qmd files, which can be formatted as Git-Flavored Markdown (GFM) and consequently display a much more polished document inside of Github. The README files in each subfolder are copies of the quarto output GFM file for each analysis. If you want to see the nice-looking, as-originally-intended analyses, you'll just have to download the html file and open it up.
