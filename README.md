# analyses
Some statistical analyses performed either as part of a class or for personal enjoyment. 

The .md files look awful because they are from .Rmd files which I intended to be knitted into html files. So the .mds exist only to give a (very) rough idea of what each subfolder is about, if you want to read it the way it is meant to be read download the html file. 

Start with these:
- Ricks Building Bottle Filler
- Video Games
- Hymns
